## Open Stage

Maybe this is all new to you – or maybe it will remind you of the cabarets in Herräng.  Open Stage is meant to host all kind of acts,  presented once a month as part of the Herräng Monthly. Swing dancers from all over the world are invited to participate by sending their contribution to the Herräng Monthly. A few chosen acts will then be unveiled in a contest format on the Patreon site. Then, all patreons will vote for their favorite performance of the month!

A theme will be presented for each individual month that all contestants must use as a foundation for their act. The themes will be presented three months in advance, so there will be plenty of time to create, practice and submit a number.

If you are interested in creating an act, please follow the instructions below:


    Pay attention to the theme of the month in question

    Create an act! Please note that your act doesn't necessarily have to involve any dancing

    Record your act and send it to us no later than the 20th a month earlier than your act is due to compete. For example, if your act is intended for the May edition of Herräng Monthly, please send your act no later than the 20th of April.

Once we have received all participating acts, we will choose a maximum of twelve acts to take part in the competition. The chosen acts will be introduced in the relevant edition of Herräng Monthly. After having all subscribers voting, the winner  will be revealed in the following month's edition of Herräng Monthly.

Come and meet Frida and Markus; the peeps behind "Aspects on music”. In this intro chapter they reminisce freely through association while sharing bits and pieces from their archives of music.

## Memory Lane


- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip471a7k9FE)

The memory lane of Herräng Dance Camp is as long as it is winding. The path begins almost 40 years ago, offering all kinds of preserved visual and audible memorabilia along the way. Ever since the early 1980s, the event has been a kaleidoscopic and free-spirited melting pot for old school jazz culture and more or less unbounded surrealism.

Memory Lane will bring you back to years past and recall times that have fled. All of the material presented was originally filmed by our late cameraman Jan Forsell. All post-production was performed only by him in direct connection to each individual year, and it is his artistic vision that speaks through the media, reflecting the different time eras and capturing for posterity Herräng as it was a certain summer. No adjustments have been made since then by anybody else -- the material should be regarded as historical documents, snapshots in time recalling the days of yore and highlighting parts of the journey through the revival era. Raw and naked. Uncensored and unfiltered.

The January edition of Memory Lane will bring us back to the summer of 1999, the year when tap and flash act dancer Fayard Nicholas of the famed Nicholas Brothers visited the camp for the very first time. It was also the year when the event organizers, The Rhythm Hot Shots (now Harlem Hot Shots), surprised Frankie and Chazz with their orchestral rendition of Tain’t What You Do. A lot of transatlantic dancers also showed up at the event as a result of the ongoing American lindy hop boom stemming from the notorious GAP commercial that swept through the country especially in 1998. Similarly, the event was also able to welcome our first Russian lindy hop proselyte, soon to be followed by many more in the early 2000s.

## Larry Schulz Archive


- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziM_mg02lAk)

In this part of the Larry Schulz archive we find Frankie Manning describing the background to Peckin', and demonstrates how to involve it in Lindy Hop. 

All of the film clips presented in this chapter come from the collection of Sandra Cameron, previous ballroom champion and dance school owner, and her husband, TV producer Larry Schulz. The material was filmed and collected in New York City by Mr. Schulz during the 1980s and 1990s, and was for many years set aside in unsorted boxes in various old school film formats. In 2018, swing dance aficionado Chris Lee got in contact with Ms. Cameron and Mr. Schulz, which led to Herräng Dance Camp sponsoring the conversion of the material into a more accessible digital format. We are happy to finally be able to release and share the material.

Herräng Dance Camp 2010

 Mabel Lee, Dawn Hampton, Sugar Sullivan and Chazz Young, but also Calle Johansson, Mark Kihara, Robert Klingvall and many more. 2010 was a busy and hectic year for many of us in the background administration. The event reached a record high in terms of attendance, and also produced an almost two-hour-long musical called What Is This Thing Called Swing?’. The latter was performed twice a week for five consecutive weeks, and with the exception of the four leading roles, featured a cast of characters drawn from a pool of new actors (often teachers) every week.

The memory lane of Herräng Dance Camp is as long as it is winding. The path begins almost 40 years ago, offering all kinds of preserved visual and audible memorabilia along the way. Ever since the early 1980s, the event has been a kaleidoscopic and free-spirited melting pot for old school jazz culture and more or less unbounded surrealism.

## Face-to-Face with Catrine Ljunggren


- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pExUYo16nnA)

Catrine Ljunggren came across both tap dancing and lindy hoppin’ at an early age, and is undoubtedly among the pioneers of the 1980s revival generation. In 1985, she co-founded The Rhythm Hot Shots (now Harlem Hot Shots) and soon found herself in the middle of the ongoing spread of swing dancing which continues to this day. Over the years, Catrine has been a recognised performer and teacher, also in dance forms other than traditional jazz dances.

Summer of ’95   The event was still reasonably small and somewhat laid back. Some ten to twelve countries were represented, and the official language of the camp began to switch from Swedish to English. Frankie and Chazz were the obvious headliners, followed by Dawn Hampton, Chester Whitmore, Mickey Davidson, Lance Benishek, Simon Selmon and many more.

## Memory Lane

Herräng Dance Camp 2007  There is no doubt that the 2007 event is one of the most memorable ones. The camp celebrated its 25th anniversary, and it was also sadly the last year that the legendary Frankie Manning visited Herräng Dance Camp. After 19 consecutive years of visiting each summer, Frankie never made it back to the 2008 event and the following year he had already passed. Mister Manning’s presence was for many years the camp’s raison d'être, and his legacy and contribution to the event can never be understated.

The second interview was with Alexey Kazenov from Moscow (Russia) about his residency in Warsaw (Poland). At the end of my report, I had a small party with the amazing band Heart of Dixie, introducing their first album to everyone.

Roumany and Martina:

Plenty of interviews this month! On one side Valencia, Berlin and Turin for our European segment touching upon the world of chorus lines and online events. On the other side, we show you the first Arabic scene in Beirut and some enthusiastic dancing from the guys in Uganda for Middle East and Africa.

This month, we are visiting some personalities from the Canadian swing dance scene to learn how they have been spending the past extraordinary year, away from their 'normal everyday life'. Rusty Frank and Jean Veloz are close friends - Rusty talks about the time they spent together in Herräng and shares one of her most special memories from that time. Enjoy!
